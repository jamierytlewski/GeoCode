GeoCode
=======
I created this to update latitude and longitude to a DB. 

You'll need to add your Bing Key and DB Connection. 

The table names are hardcoded, so if your table names are different you need to change the table names.

I used Bing as it seemed more precise when just doing straight zip code lookups.
